Appa is user-friendly application that will be used to help visually impaired students or individuals at California State University, Northridge. <br />
The idea was brought up when we realized that the university does not provide a wide variety of options for those who are visually impaired. <br />
We want to create an app that will provide them guidance and information without having the need of a second person. <br />
